    "| **Definition**| A model that transforms an input sequence into an output sequence using an encoder and decoder. | A deep learning architecture using self-attention mechanisms to process input sequences. | A specific Transformer model designed for generating text by predicting the next word in a sequence. | Variants of the GPT model with different sizes and capacities for generating text. |\n",
    "| **Usage**     | Tasks where input and output are sequences, like translation and summarization. | A wide range of NLP tasks, including translation and summarization. | Primarily used for text generation tasks like chatbots and text completion. | Used for similar text generation tasks, with larger models generally providing better performance and coherence. |\n",
    "| **Information**| Consists of an encoder that processes the input and a decoder that generates the output. | Composed of an encoder and decoder stack, using self-attention to capture relationships between words. | Utilizes only the decoder part of the Transformer, focusing on unidirectional text generation. | Small has fewer parameters, while medium and large have progressively more, enhancing their ability to understand and generate text. |\n",
    "| **Strengths** | Effective for varying output lengths; good at capturing context. | Can process sequences in parallel; captures long-range dependencies well. | Excellent at generating coherent and contextually relevant text; adapts to various topics. | Larger models (medium and large) can generate more sophisticated and nuanced text compared to the small model. |\n",
    "| **Limitations**| Struggles with long sequences due to fixed-length context vectors; may not capture long-range dependencies well. | Requires substantial data and computational power; complexity can make fine-tuning harder. | May generate repetitive or nonsensical outputs; unidirectional nature limits contextual understanding compared to bidirectional models. | Small may struggle with complexity in tasks, while larger models require more computational resources and memory. |\n",
    "| **Applications**| Machine translation, text summarization, conversational agents. | Machine translation, text generation, sentiment analysis. | Chatbots, text completion, creative writing assistance. | Similar applications as GPT, with larger models often preferred for more demanding tasks. |\n"

    "Let us understand the following code to train the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Importing Libraries**:\n",
    "   - The code starts by importing `TrainingArguments` and `Trainer` from the `transformers` library, which are essential for setting up and managing the training process of machine learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Setting Training Arguments**:\n",
    "   - A `TrainingArguments` object named `training_args` is created, where various parameters related to training are specified:\n",
    "   - `per_device_train_batch_size=32`: This sets the number of training samples to be processed at one time (batch size) to 32 for each device (like CPU or GPU).\n",
    "   - `per_device_eval_batch_size=32`: Similarly, this sets the evaluation batch size to 32.\n",
    "   - `output_dir=\"./results\"`: This specifies the directory where the training results (like model checkpoints) will be saved, here it's a folder named \"results\".\n",
    "   - `learning_rate=2e-4`: This sets the learning rate, which controls how much to change the model's weights during training; in this case, it is set to 0.0002.\n",
    "   - `weight_decay=0.01`: This adds a penalty to the model weights to prevent overfitting, with a decay factor of 0.01.\n",
    "   - `evaluation_strategy=\"epoch\"`: This indicates that the model will be evaluated at the end of each training epoch.\n",
    "   - `save_strategy=\"epoch\"`: This means the model will be saved at the end of each epoch as well.\n",
    "   - `load_best_model_at_end=True`: After training, the best model (based on evaluation metrics) will be loaded automatically.\n",
    "   - `num_train_epochs=3`: This sets the total number of times the model will go through the entire training dataset, which is 3 epochs.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Creating the Trainer**:\n",
    "   - A `Trainer` object named `trainer` is instantiated, which will handle the training and evaluation of the model. The following parameters are passed to it:\n",
    "   - `model=lora_model`: This specifies the model to be trained, which is referenced by the variable `lora_model`.\n",
    "   - `args=training_args`: This passes the training arguments that were defined earlier.\n",
    "   - `tokenizer=tokenizer`: This provides the tokenizer that will be used to preprocess the text data for the model.\n",
    "   - `train_dataset=tok_train_ds`: This sets the training dataset, which is referenced by the variable `tok_train_ds`.\n",
    "   - `eval_dataset=tok_eval_ds`: This sets the evaluation dataset, referenced by the variable `tok_eval_ds`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, this code is preparing everything necessary to train a machine learning model using specified settings and datasets, while also ensuring that evaluation and saving of the best model are handled automatically.\n"
